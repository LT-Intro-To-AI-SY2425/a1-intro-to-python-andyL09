# ### 2. **Basic Calculator**:
#    - Create a simple calculator program that takes two 
#       numbers as input and asks the user which operation 
#       (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) they 
#       would like to perform. Display the result and ask if 
#       they want to perform another calculation.

userOperation = input("Welcome to calculator enter 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide' depending on what operation you want to do")

def twoNumbers():
    firstNumber = int(input("enter the first number:"))
    secondNumber = int(input("enter the second number:"))
    
    if userOperation == "add":
        print(firstNumber + secondNumber)
    elif userOperation == "sutract":
        print(firstNumber - secondNumber)
    elif userOperation == "multiply":
        print(firstNumber * secondNumber)
    elif userOperation == "divide":
        print(firstNumber / secondNumber)

if userOperation == "add" :
    print("You haved selected to add")
    twoNumbers()
