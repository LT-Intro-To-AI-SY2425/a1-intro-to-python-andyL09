#note the ai didnt ask me to do this fizzbuzz test but 
# i thought i was supposted to so im just gonna leave it here
# also not sure if it actually works and i have no idea what im doing

number = 0

for x in range(1, 16):
    result = number 
    if number % 3 == 0:
        
    number = number + 1


# just ignore that i dont know how to do that right now

#Prompt:
#"Hey im a highschool student in a intro to Ai class.  
# We also do a fair bit of python programming.  
# Could you generate a few python programs for me to do?
#   Ive done a fiar bit of javascript programming before 
# and a little bit of C++ but im pretty rusty, so maybe
#  beginner ish level questions.  "

#Response:
# #"Great! I can suggest a few beginner-level Python programs that will help you practice the basics and introduce some AI concepts:

# ### 1. **Number Guessing Game**:
#    - Write a program that picks a random number between
#      1 and 100, and allows the user to guess the number.
#      The program should tell the user if their guess is
#      too high, too low, or correct. Once the user 
#      guesses correctly, display how many guesses it took.

# ### 2. **Basic Calculator**:
#    - Create a simple calculator program that takes two 
#       numbers as input and asks the user which operation 
#       (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) they 
#       would like to perform. Display the result and ask if 
#       they want to perform another calculation.

# ### 3. **Palindrome Checker**:
#    - Write a Python program that takes a word as input 
#       and checks if it is a palindrome (a word that reads the 
#       same backward as forward).

# ### 4. **Simple AI: Chatbot**:
#    - Create a basic chatbot using `if` and `else` statements. The program should take input from the user and respond to simple keywords like "hello", "bye", or "how are you?". You can expand this with more responses as you get comfortable.

# ### 5. **FizzBuzz Challenge**:
#    - Print numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples 
#       of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for 
#       multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers that are 
#       multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

# ### 6. **AI Concept: Random Walk Simulation**:
#    - Create a simple program that simulates a 
#       "random walk." The idea is that a point starts at 
#       the origin (0,0) and randomly moves either up, 
#       down, left, or right. Run this simulation for 
#       1000 steps and plot the final position (you can 
#       use `matplotlib` for plotting).

# These should give you a good mix of basic Python concepts and a slight taste of AI with the random walk!"
