# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

Ive done a little bit of python programming before so i kind of knew what to expect.  It was pretty easy to get the hang of it after a bit of pratice.  Some stuff was a lot more challenging than i thought it would be though. I struggled with some of the problems in a1.py i didnt recignise all of the methods used in the python functions.  The use of tests was also pretty new to me and are going to take a little bit of work to get used to but they are defently useful.  

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Python is a bid diffrent from swift in the way that it dosent have a UI building thing built into the language.  In swift swiftUI is built right in and its sort of like working with a fancy HTML kinda thing.  Python dosent really have any UI stuff built in it needs some libraries to do anything like that.  It feels more similar to javascript in the way that it really only does logic in its base form but need some help for doing any UI stuff.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

I shouldnt overestimate myself too much and should probally read stuff a little more closely.  I also should ask more questions when i am confused on parts of the assingment.  That would help me learn more and it would also take less time to learn the material that way.  I got a little more experience with chatGPT and how to use it to help solve my problems and gain a b3etter understanding of things too.
